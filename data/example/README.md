## Example Images and Results
We proccessed one image from each class (Normal, Pre-Plus, Plus) as an example of our system. In this folder, you can find raw images, their segmentations, features and scores. All these files can be regenerated by running the following line. 

```
python mainScript.py "example/" "exampleImages.xlsx" "scoresOfExampleImages.xlsx" 
```
Note that features are generated using the segmented images located  under "Segmentated/SegmentationsFromBrownetal".

For details about the segmentation modules please have a look at the following links.
